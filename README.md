This project was my crash course into the world of backend development—guided (and occasionally derailed) by the “Make a Blog with Raddy” tutorial on YouTube. The original tutorial provided a great foundation, but I couldn’t resist tweaking things to match my own taste and workflow.

Built using:

1. Node.js (because backend ≠ boring)
2. MongoDB (via a free cluster—budget dev life)

This version includes some personal modifications, but full credit to the original tutorial: Make a Blog with Raddy (https://youtu.be/-foo92lFIto?si=KfH707yTWhpnzp6z)
